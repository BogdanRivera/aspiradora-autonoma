This project simulates the operation of an autonomous vacuum cleaner inside an interactive board. The vacuum cleaner is designed to collect trash using two main algorithms: Random motion and Breadth-First Search (BFS). The graphical interface allows to visualize the behavior of the vacuum cleaner while cleaning the board and displays relevant information such as the elapsed time and the amount of trash collected.

## Features

- **Friendly graphical interface**: Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
- **Interactive grid**: Represents the space that the vacuum cleaner cleans.
- **Two movement algorithms**:
- Random movement.
- Breadth-first search (BFS).
- **Dynamic indicators**:
- Counter of collected trash.
- Timer to measure elapsed time.
- **Reset and trash generation options**:
- Random trash generation in empty cells.
- Complete reset of the board.

## Technologies used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Visual style**: Bootstrap 4.5.2.
- **Vacuum logic**: Algorithms implemented in JavaScript.

## How to use the project

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_user/project-vacuum.git
```
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.

3. Interface:

Use the "Generate Garbage" button to fill the board with random garbage.
Select an algorithm in the right section and click "Select Algorithm".
Start the cleanup with the "Start Search" button.
Reset the board with the "Reset" button.



## Results and Celebration

At the end of each game, it will be revealed if you guessed correctly and in how many attempts. Celebrate your victories and keep improving!
